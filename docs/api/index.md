# API Reference

The API reference is generated from TypeScript sources via TypeDoc.

- Start here: [`Reference Index`](./reference/)

Notes:

- The reference is mostly language-neutral (identifiers, types), but text is in English.
- If you need a stable surface, prefer imports from the package root (`import { ... } from 'yukitasan'`).
